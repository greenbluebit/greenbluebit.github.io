description: With this project, we created a ragdoll based game where you drag people either to hell or heaven, and pay the price for it. The game has a straight forward style to it and as such the development reflected that. Our work was not required to encompass many features, but simply make one and perfect it, adding as much juice as possible.<br><br>Responsabilities:<br>- Ragdoll implementation<br>- Level setup and prefab creation<br>- GameManager to keep track of choices and score<br>- SceneManager to switch between scenes as well as play required animations<br>- AnimationManager which would trigger any event specified in the inspector on any event it would be attached to<br>- InputManager to give the ability to move characters by dragging them around the screen<br>- Lead a team of myself and another programmer and review tasks
