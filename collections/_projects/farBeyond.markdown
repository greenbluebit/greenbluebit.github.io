description: The second time I ever did a gamejam, used the Unreal Engine though I had never opened it, my insanity is clear. The game is heavily reliant on it's narrative, taking the player through a wasteland and slowly giving him details of what happened, ending in the player having too much and deciding to do something about it.<br><br>Responsabilities:<br>- Creating the behavior for interacting with objects, showing them up close, for example, to read a newspaper.<br>- Creating the frost functionality, where the player has to hurry between camps, least he loose too much body heat and die.<br>- Make the end cinematic using the Sequencer tool in unreal.
