description: My role in the development of this game was that of Lead Developer. There was another programmer who had less experience than me, so I spread my time between actually developing features, creating tasks in trello and reviewing his work.<br>The game is a straightforward underwater level where the main goal is to get to the surface. Along the way, you'll encounter threats such as mines, smart bombs and underwater creatures. It also features a fun dialogue system between the two characters in the submarine, who react to different stimuli, such as the vessel having low health, low fuel, encountering certain enemies or simply piloting it badly.<br>It was designed with two players in mind, one controlling where the engine is directing the submarine while the other directing the turret, but that can also be done from one controller, each stick handling one of the tasks.<br><br>Responsabilities:<br>- Implement fuel/health of the vessel and display the info on the sub itself.<br>- Implement thrust and control over the engine.<br>- Implement the turret gameplay.<br>- Review the dialog functionality created by the other developer and advice/help wherever needed.<br>- Create behavior for mines, smart bombs and other enemies.<br>- Work together with the VFX person to create effects for the spotlight and explosions using Amplify Shader Editor.
