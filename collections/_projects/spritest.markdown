description: During the game jams I've been a part of, issues have often popped up. As a passionate programmer I enjoy making tools to help people, this is one of them.<br>When making sprites, tools for it often lack certain features, one of these is exporting a sheet from multiple animation frames. By passsing images to this program, a sheet containing all of them will be generated. This spritesheet can later be downloaded and used in any engine that supports spritesheets, such as Unity or directly read by anything and animated, such as javascript.<br>We often also need to show work in progress, to keep up with the event and to offer content to be later shown by the organizers. This program handles that too, by creating gifs from the created animations, which can be exported quickly to giphy.<br><br>Spritest has also been used by marketing students often to create animated banners for their projects and is even used by companies to place ads on their products.
