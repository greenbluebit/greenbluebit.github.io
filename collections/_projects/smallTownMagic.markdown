description: We made this game for NGJ2020. It's a simple city builder with Tetris-like elements where each structure comes in form of a card available for the player to use. The idea is to build beautiful towns, and experience the procedurally generated story at the end, based on the people who live in the town.The player starts with a set amount of money and must balance out costs of certain buildings with income from others. These values get affected by the decoration structures and by the amount of homes in a town. The game ends when the player enters bankrupcy.<br><br>Functionally, the game is centered around a grid-based map, each structure occupying one to more cells. There is a simple day/night cycle using post-processing and each 24 ingame hours, money is added to the budget based on the amount of homes and their satisfaction. Each home placed by the player is procedurally generated based on a list of pre-made parts and it also contains a family formed with a small bio and family name. At the end of the game, a small story is generated from the different families, based on their satisfaction levels.<br><br>Credits:<br>- Austeja Vaicyte | Artist<br>- Theodor F Purcaru | Programmer
