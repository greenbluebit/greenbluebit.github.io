description: During fall of 2017, my girlfriend and I decided to participate in AsylumJam2017, her as the artist and I, of course, as the programmer. The game we made is an atmospheric exploration game where you try to survive, go through different levels, and figure out a way out of it for good.<br><br>Responsabilities:<br>- Create a state machine for the AI who can run from or towards the player, be idle, patrol and attack.<br>- Create a level generation code which uses parts created by the artist set in different categories (such as "wall decoration", "floor decoration", "story element").<br>- Create ability for user to drain AI of life.<br>- Create behavior which can be extended at any time using the command pattern.
