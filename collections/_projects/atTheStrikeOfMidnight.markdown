description: The theme for this jam was "At the Strike of MidKnight" and we took that quite literally. It's a tower defense game where the player is a princess in her castle, minding her own business, when knights start showing off decided to "save" her. In the current version of the game she can place down different towers and walls however the idea was that creatures which in fairy tales would seem evil, especially to the knights, would be her friends and help her get the knights to leave her alone.<br><br>The game relies on a hexagonal grid and uses breadth-first search to find all of the shortest paths. I chose this instead of A* because I wanted all possible paths from the spawn point to the target, not just for one entity. The pathfinding gets recalculated every time obstacles are changed on the map by the player.<br><br>Oh and the flowers are procedurally generated.<br><br>Credits:<br>- Austeja Vaicyte | Lead Artist<br>- Edward Giurgiu | Artist<br>- Theodor F Purcaru | Programmer
