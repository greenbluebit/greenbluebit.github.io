description: This game was made during one of the first game jams I ever participated in. It's a infinite platformer with pre-made chinks of levels which are loaded in randomly as the player keeps going up, giving the illusion of an infinite level while still guaranteeing interesting and fun level design.<br>The game also has a nice feature where the difficulty is directly proportional to the music intensity, the more intense the song is, the more threats get spawned and the faster the main threat goes towards the player.<br><br>Responsabilities:<br>- Create functionality to get the intensity of a song and spawn threats accordingly.<br>- Create level section spawner as the player moves.<br>- Create sanity system which would act as the health of the game.<br>- Create pickup items and functionality for them.<br>- Create traps that player can use, such as confetti canons.<br>- Music player functionality which can use music from the players device.<br>- Port to android with multiple control schemas.
