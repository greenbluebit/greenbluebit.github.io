description: In the fourth semester of my bachelor, I had the opportunity to do my internship at a company in Copenhagen which handled designing, manufacturing and delivering of physical advertisements through Europe. The large amount of projects the company would have to do created a huge overhead for tracking everything as well as calculating payments, keeping statistics for different metrics over the years as well as sharing information between employees.<br>That's where the solution I developed for them came in. These are some of the most important features of the system:<br>- It allows users to create projects and track their process as well as materials and specifications.<br>- Uploading of documents and designs associated with each project.<br>- Calculation of costs for each partner and employee part of specific projects as well as earnings for the company.<br>- Metrics such as profit, costs, parts usage, amount of parts used and projects per employee.<br><br>I made this project using Laravel and MySQL predominantly, for the frontend using a mix of pure js and jQuery.
