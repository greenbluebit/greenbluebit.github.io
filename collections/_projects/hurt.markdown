description: For the MiniJam65 I made a narrative driven game where the player slowly explores their environment in hopes of figuring out what is happening. The whole story would have had the player eventually discovering they had died and the entire gameplay section being a sort of Limbo, where his guilt and self-hatred would keep him in a constant loop. <br><br>The game uses asynchronous scene loading to quickly change and merge scenes, this helps with having as many interactables and details as I would want to place, since the area would be small and self contained. It also has a rain shader I wrote in Cg.<br><br>The interactables function with contracts. This architecture allows me to expand and create anything for the player to use quickly and was very helpful to get something functional quickly during the gamejam.
