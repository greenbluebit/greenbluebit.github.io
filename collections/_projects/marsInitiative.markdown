description: I finally got to participate in Ludum Dare. My entry was a basic resource management game, which the player can really only interact with by tapping/clicking on the screen. I originally released it on PC in the first day of the contest, and spent the rest of my time fixing it and releasing it on Android.<br>The game itself is easy to play and very serene once you get in the groove of things. As a colony manager, you need to send factories down while managing available space and fuel.<br><br>I later came back to the game and added more features such as different planets, laser cannons, station animations and fixed the menu to work nicely and more android devices.<br><br>Responsabilities:<br>- Make basic behavior for orbiting around celestial objects<br>- Make autopilot behavior for the missiles traveling to a target<br>- Make score and fuel tracking functionality<br>- Make laser fire using raycast to decide on length<br>- Implement different planet types
