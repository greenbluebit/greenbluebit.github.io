description: We made swing macabre for one of the few online jams I've taken part in. This game is a third person shoot-em up where a jukebox fell from the sky and is turning people into undead swing dancers, the infection is spreading and you need to keep away before you catch it too.<br><br>Responsabilities:<br>- Make a state machine for the AI which can follow/attack the player, idle, go towards the jukebox, dance around it.<br>- Development on player functionality from animation control to movement and shooting gameplay.<br>- Spawning AI at an increased rate as the player goes through waves of enemies.<br>
