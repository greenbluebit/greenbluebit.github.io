description: During the '#createjamfall2019', I participated solo and decided to make a third person game, with a heavy emphasis on platforming. I ended up not being able to publish the game before the deadline but I got around to finishing it eventually. The idea for the game is that in a perfect simulation, you appear as a glitch in the system and try to find your way out. Through the game, it would later be visible that you're not the first glitch, and that the system itself might be making you for a reason, which would be later revealed.<br><br>The player has four special abilities that they can switch between:<br><br>- FORCE | the player can pull objects and then throw them, once they hit something any enemy in the area will focus on that object.<br>- SHIELD | the player can invoke a sphere around them which blocks all attacks, if the attack hits in the beginning of using the shield, the bullet hits back in whoever shot it.<br>- SLOW | the player slows down the whole world around themselves, making it possible to run through a room full of enemies or slowing down environmental threats.<br>- SWORD | the player can either slice enemies or warp to an enemy, instantly killing them over a distance.<br><br>The game also has different ways for the player to move around, such as wall running, jump pads, stealth walking and different types of platforms and doors to hack. I also built an extensive settings menu which allows to volume control, switching fullscreen mode and inverting the mouse/gamepad camera controls.<br>It also has a respawn system where if a player falls down, the last recorded safe spot they were on is used to respawn on, as well as taking away some of their health.<br><br>

      description: In the first day of the jam I implemented IK, but this made the game not feel as fluid when changing between platforming, wall-running and jumping over other entities.

      description: This was made after the jam, this is why I had the time to make 2 versions, since the first one seemed a bit too...phallic.

      description: After the jam, I added this threat to the player, it's supposed to be something that sparks curiosity and swiftly punished the player if they get too close.
