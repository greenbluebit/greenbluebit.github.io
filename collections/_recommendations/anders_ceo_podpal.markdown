description: I’ve worked with Theodor during his time at PodPal Games. His projects had him work both directly supervised by me as well as independently, developing features and tools to aid our development.<br><br>In the beginning, he joined us as a student intern, traveling to Norway to be a part of the office. He quickly got accustomed to the culture and was a jovial member of the team, trying to be helpful, fixing things wherever possible. He took his responsibilities seriously and was always ready to get a feature done towards the deadline, managing both the stress and the workload.<br><br>Later he continued working on features part-time and produced content that we felt happy to present to the public, always showcasing great elements of the game and making our project have a good feel of polish through his attention to detail and drive to keep developing functionality and enthusiastic attitude while coming up with new ideas and creating quick prototypes to explain his thought process.<br><br>He often worked independently, having me review and discuss his work and sometimes asking for help, eager to learn something new. During our review sessions,he took critique as a chance to improve, interested in fixing and getting the final feature finished.<br><br>I believe Theodor Florian Purcaru is a great addition to any company that he’ll be part of as he is a hard worker and someone who always tries to become better.
