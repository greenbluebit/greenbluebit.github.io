description: I have known Theodor Florian Purcaru for over 3 years, during this time I have been struck by his professional behavior and teamwork. He has always been supervised by me as the chief architect and he has always understood and followed my designs, as well as openly discussed his own ideas in situations and has never been without a wish to learn and explore his own possibility of solving problems.<br><br>He began his career as a part of my team, but eventually, through hard work, started leading his own team. A wish to learn is very useful, but he also has a pull towards teaching others. As such, his team was always one of the more independent cells we had due to the fact that all of his co-workers could go to him and ask for help, and if it was anything that he ever did not understand, he felt nothing stopped him from asking me, showing that he was far more interested in finishing the product and hitting the deadline instead of preserving an image.<br><br>During our work, we had many times when deadlines kept coming down on us and we were stressed, but he was always there, seeing how he can help, keeping our spirits high and trying to understand what the problem was and where it could be fixed for current or future releases.<br><br>In conclusion, Theodor Florian Purcaru is the kind of person any team would want to have who will not only elevate himself but bring others up with him. His interest in development goes not only during his job but in his personal time too, which is enhanced by his wish to learn more and makes him a very good Software Developer.
