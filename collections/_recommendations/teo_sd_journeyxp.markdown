description: I am writing this to recommend my co-worker Theodor Florian Purcaru, with whom I worked at the same company, JourneyXP, for four years. During the last two of those four years, we worked together on the same projects and I have observed the skills that Theodor has and the way he addresses problems.<br><br>Our work involved developing systems for data translation and storage between different formats. This required the development of Java solutions using technologies like SQLite for local storage and redundancy handling as well as communication between systems using CouchDB and RabbitMQ. As a team, we distributed our responsibilities equally in order to get a chance to get fluent with all of the technologies we would be exposed to. This allowed us to excel together.<br><br>A great quality I noticed in Theodor is the thoroughness with which he researches all the new tools and technologies that he is faced with. This thoroughness is useful to his coding as well as his testing skills. Most of the projects we worked on ended up having over 90% test coverage. This extends even further than code. He worked closely with the QA department and the business side to be able to organize scenarios of usage for our systems in his test cases. This helped us a lot by ensuring that we will not be caught unaware by the expectations or uses of our software, allowing us to avoid common issues.<br><br>Besides his great skills as a developer, Theodor is also a very pleasant person to work with and be around. In the four years when we worked together, I've never seen him causing any problems with other employees. He is humble in his achievements and never hides his mistakes, but rather brings them forward and works hard to fix them.<br><br>It pleases me greatly to recommend Theodor Florian Purcaru and get to be a part of his continuous growth as a developer and as a person.
