description: The two years studying for the master degree presented me with the opportunity to get a better understanding of both abstract topics such as Computability and Complexity as well as the specific intricacies of how a compiler works, by making one. In the last two semesters I worked primarily towards my thesis, with a focus in Human-Computer Interaction. This work culminated in the development of a haptic glove to be used as an alternative to learning the saxophone to supplement regular ones.
