title: Bachelor of Computer Science
organization: University College of Northern Denmark
order_id: 3
period: 01/09/2012 - 15/06/2019
description: During the years I spend doing my Bachelor, we focused both on the practical asspects of software development as well as the more theoretical aspects of Computer Science, such as Discrete Mathematics and Syntax and Semantics. Further semesters focused on the proper etiquete and practice in writing a Research Paper as well as the development of large scale system development and system integration. The education culminated in a long-form internship that I took at Age of Space. It is spread in 7 years because I took 3 years off between AP and Top-Up to work full time in Copenhagen at JourneyXP.
